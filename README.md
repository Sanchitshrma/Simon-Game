**SIMON GAME**

The Simon Game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game where players must replicate an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. Created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this version features a modern interface and interactive gameplay. The game includes dynamic animations, audio cues, and progressively challenging sequences to test players' memory and reflexes. Itâ€™s a great project for showcasing frontend development skills and JavaScript logic.

**TECH OVERVIEW**

The Simon Game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS leverages core web technologies to create a responsive and interactive user experience. Here's a tech overview:

1. **HTML**: 
   - Used for structuring the game's interface. Each color in the Simon game is represented by a clickable button element, which players interact with to play the game. The structure includes a score display and start/reset buttons.

2. **CSS**:
   - Provides the styling for the game, including layout, colors, and animations. CSS transitions and keyframes are used to create smooth color and button effects, enhancing the gameplay experience.
   - Media queries ensure the game is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - The primary logic of the game is driven by JavaScript. It handles user interactions, game state management, and the generation of the random sequences.
   - Event listeners are used to detect player clicks and trigger corresponding actions.
   - The game sequence is stored in an array, and JavaScript is used to animate the colors and sounds in sync, guiding the player through each round.
   - Game progression is managed by incrementally increasing the sequence length with each successful round, providing a challenge as the player advances.
   - Game-over conditions are implemented, where the player loses if they click an incorrect color, with options to restart the game.

This project demonstrates proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, and leveraging CSS for animations and visual effects, making it a solid example of full-stack web development with a focus on frontend technologies.
